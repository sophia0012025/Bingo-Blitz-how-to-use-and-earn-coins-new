Bingo Blitz has many currencies used for different things, and coins are among those. However, unlike other currencies like Credits, how you use coins in this bingo game is slightly unclear. That’s why this Bingo Blitz guide will explain what you can do with coins and how to get more of them.

Until recently, coins in Bingo Blitz were used to buy Bingo cards, rewards and power ups. However, this has since changed. In fact, if you’re looking for ways to get more out of the game for free, which you may well be, then free credits links are by far now your best bet – and you can check out our daily free credits links guide here. Here’s everything you need to know about how to use coins in Bingo Blitz.

How to use coins in Bingo Blitz

There are many ways to get coins in Bingo Blitz, but the best one is by playing the game. You earn coins for doing bingo or winning games. You can also try levelling up, getting achievements, and part take in some activities to get coins. Additionally, you can spend real cash to get coins, but we highly discourage that.

Bingo Blitz says that you can use coins in the store to purchase various items and boosts, but when you go to the store, there is not much you can buy with them. Previously, you could use coins to buy prizes such as double XP, however this is now not the case in the popular online bingo game. The same is true for boosts, which could be previously purchased with coins, but has since been removed, and you now have to spend real money to get those.

This is in line with Bingo Blitz moving slightly towards a pay-to-play model – where gamers are now required to part with real cash to get some of the rewards on offer. The good news is that there are still daily free credit links that you can use to play the game – which offer a fantastic way of getting Bingo Blitz freebies.

As it stands we would actually advise not spending or using coins, and instead focusing on free credits links. Before, you could at least get some boosts, but that’s not the case anymore, so trying to earn coins may not be the best use of time.

Can you redeem coins on Bingo Blitz?
No, there’s no way to redeem coins in Bingo Blitz because you don’t need to. Coins are awarded to you as you play the game and can also be purchased. Once they’re purchased, you don’t need to do anything else.

We hope you collect all the rewards using the above link. Most probably, all the free credits for Bingo Blitz links work only for a limited time. If you didn’t collect rewards on time, then it’s not work anymore.
